# NOTE: This workflow uses GITHUB_TOKEN to merge, which means the resulting
# push to master will NOT trigger push-based workflows (e.g. rubyonrails.yml).
# This is acceptable because CI already runs on the PR before merge and
# deployments are handled externally (Cloud 66 / Capistrano). If a push-based
# GitHub Actions workflow is added that must run on every merge (e.g. CD),
# switch GH_TOKEN to a PAT or GitHub App token so the merge triggers it.
